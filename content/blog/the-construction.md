Hi there, 

Finally I got myself a homepage! As someone who likes simplicity, a static website hosted on Github Pages seems like the perfect solution for this. 

This is a pretty simple blog, I want it to load fast on machine, and I hope it is readable enough!

What should I put on my blog post? So far I have: 

- My contact information.
- Categorized blogposts, 1 category only so far!
- One or two blogposts, including this one.

What to do next? 

- Work so I have content to write on this blog!
